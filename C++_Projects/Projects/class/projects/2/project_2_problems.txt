Problems:
- Getting the alphabet to swap on the Casesar Cipher
- Setting up the reverse alphabet on the atbash cipher
- Outputting the results to the files
- Arrays being modified from the encryption functions, and not being reset

Solutions:
- I hardcoded the alphabet array in both functions of encryption, but for the atbash funstion, I added a reverse char array that I then used a for loop to setup as a reverse alphabet
- I just used the fstream library to get output to both files
- Having the array be reset before the second encryption function

I first started by using the example "GOOD BYE", and testing both functions with that, and then went to try the given plaintext that was required for the project
