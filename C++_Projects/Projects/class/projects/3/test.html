A <b>novice</b> asked the master: "I have a program that sometime runs 
and sometimes aborts. I have followed the rules of programming, yet I am
 totally baffled. What is the reason for this?"<br>

you expect it from a machine that humans have constructed? Computers 
simulate determinism; only Tao is perfect.
